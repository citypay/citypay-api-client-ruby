#CityPay Payment API

# This CityPay API is a HTTP RESTful payment API used for direct server to server transactional processing. It provides a number of payment mechanisms including: Internet, MOTO, Continuous Authority transaction processing, 3-D Secure decision handling using RFA Secure, Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids and Completion processing. The API is also capable of tokinsed payments using Card Holder Accounts.  ## Compliance and Security <aside class=\"notice\">   Before we begin a reminder that your application will need to adhere to PCI-DSS standards to operate safely   and to meet requirements set out by Visa and MasterCard and the PCI Security Standards Council including: </aside>  * Data must be collected using TLS version 1.2 using [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). We will not accept calls to our API at   lower grade encryption levels. We regularly scan our TLS endpoints for vulnerabilities and perform TLS assessments   as part of our compliance program. * The application must not store sensitive card holder data (CHD) such as the card security code (CSC) or   primary access number (PAN) * The application must not display the full card number on receipts, it is recommended to mask the PAN   and show the last 4 digits. The API will return this for you for ease of receipt creation * If you are developing a website, you will be required to perform regular scans on the network where you host the   application to meet your compliance obligations * You will be required to be PCI Compliant and the application must adhere to the security standard. Further information   is available from [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) * The API verifies that the request is for a valid account and originates from a trusted source using the remote IP   address. Our application firewalls analyse data that may be an attempt to break a large number of security common   security vulnerabilities.
